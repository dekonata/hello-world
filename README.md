# hello-world
My first GitHub repository 

Hi Humans!

Kriegler here. I am almost 40 and recently started to learning to code in Python. 
I do work in a technical space and I am sure some coding could be usefull, I worry that I have missed the tide and I am now to far behind to catch the ship.
Even so, my motto for this has been: "Just keep going!." Exited to see where it takes me.
